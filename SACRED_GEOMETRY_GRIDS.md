## Drawing with Sacred Geometry

### Flower of Life Techniques
1. **Center Point Drawing**: Start from the center circle for radial designs
2. **Intersection Snapping**: Use circle intersections for precise connections
3. **Radial Patterns**: Create designs that radiate from the center
4. **Organic Shapes**: Follow the circular patterns for natural forms

### Diamond Scale Techniques
1. **Tessellation**: Create repeating diamond patterns
2. **Scale Effects**: Build fish scale or armor-like patterns
3. **Geometric Precision**: Use diamond vertices for sharp angles
4. **Layered Designs**: Work with inner and outer diamond shapes

## Practical Applications

### Fashion Design
- **Flower of Life**: Organic prints, flowing patterns, spiritual motifs
- **Diamond Scale**: Geometric prints, structured designs, modern patterns

### Logo Design
- **Flower of Life**: Organic, spiritual, or natural brand identities
- **Diamond Scale**: Modern, geometric, or luxury brand identities

### Pattern Making
- **Flower of Life**: Mandala patterns, circular motifs, organic repeats
- **Diamond Scale**: Geometric repeats, tessellations, structured patterns

### Technical Drawing
- **Standard Grid**: Precise measurements, technical specifications
- **Sacred Geometry**: Artistic technical drawings with geometric harmony

## Tips and Best Practices

### Getting Started
1. **Choose Your Grid**: Select the grid that matches your design intent
2. **Enable Snapping**: Turn on grid snapping for precise placement
3. **Adjust Opacity**: Set grid visibility to comfortable level
4. **Practice**: Experiment with different grid types

### Advanced Techniques
1. **Grid Switching**: Switch between grids during design process
2. **Combination Use**: Use multiple grids for complex designs
3. **Guide Lines**: Pay attention to guide lines for alignment
4. **Symmetry**: Combine with symmetry mode for balanced designs

### Performance Tips
1. **Grid Visibility**: Hide grids when not needed for better performance
2. **Snap Threshold**: Adjust snap distance based on zoom level
3. **Layer Organization**: Use separate layers for different grid elements

## Technical Details

### Grid Configuration
```typescript
interface GridConfig {
  type: GridType;           // 'standard' | 'flower-of-life' | 'diamond-scale'
  unit: GridUnit;           // 'cm' | 'inch'
  scale: number;            // Grid scale factor
  opacity: number;          // Grid visibility (0.1 to 1.0)
  showGuides: boolean;      // Show guide lines
  snapToGrid: boolean;      // Enable grid snapping
  snapThreshold: number;    // Snap distance in pixels
}
```

### Snap Points
- **Flower of Life**: 19 primary snap points (center + 6 surrounding + 6 extended + 6 seed)
- **Diamond Scale**: Dynamic snap points based on viewport and diamond size
- **Standard Grid**: Grid intersections based on unit size

### Performance Optimization
- **Viewport Culling**: Only render visible grid elements
- **Memoization**: Grid patterns are memoized for performance
- **Lazy Rendering**: Grids render only when needed

## Examples and Inspiration

### Flower of Life Examples
- Mandala designs
- Sacred geometry art
- Organic jewelry patterns
- Healing art motifs
